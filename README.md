## The Problem

You want to write maintainable tests for your [Qwik][qwik] components.

[qwik]: https://qwik.dev/

## This Solution

`@noma.to/qwik-testing-library` is a lightweight library for testing Qwik
components. It provides functions on top of `qwik` and
`@testing-library/dom` so you can mount Qwik components and query their
rendered output in the DOM. Its primary guiding principle is:

> [The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more
> confidence they can give you.][guiding-principle]

[guiding-principle]: https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```shell
npm install --save-dev @noma.to/qwik-testing-library @testing-library/dom
```

This library supports `qwik` versions `1.7.2` and above and `@testing-library/dom` versions `10.1.0` and above.

You may also be interested in installing `@testing-library/jest-dom` and `@testing-library/user-event` so you can
use [the custom jest matchers][jest-dom] and [the user event library][user-event] to test interactions with the DOM.

```shell
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
```

Finally, we need a DOM environment to run the tests in.
This library was tested (for now) only with `jsdom` so we recommend using it:

```shell
npm install --save-dev jsdom
```

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/

[node]: https://nodejs.org

[jest-dom]: https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom

[user-event]: https://github.com/testing-library/user-event

## Setup

We recommend using `@noma.to/qwik-testing-library` with [Vitest][vitest] as your test
runner.

If you haven't done so already, add vitest to your project using Qwik CLI:

```shell
npm run qwik add vitest
```

After that, we need to configure Vitest so it can run your tests.
For this, create a _separate_ `vitest.config.ts` so you don't have to modify your project's `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
// vitest.config.ts

import {defineConfig, mergeConfig} from "vitest/config";
import viteConfig from "./vite.config";

export default defineConfig((configEnv) =>
  mergeConfig(
    viteConfig(configEnv),
    defineConfig({
      // qwik-testing-library needs to consider your project as a Qwik lib
      // if it's already a Qwik lib, you can remove this section
      build: {
        target: "es2020",
        lib: {
          entry: "./src/index.ts",
          formats: ["es", "cjs"],
          fileName: (format, entryName) =>
            `${entryName}.qwik.${format === "es" ? "mjs" : "cjs"}`,
        },
      },
      // configure your test environment
      test: {
        environment: "jsdom",
        setupFiles: ["./vitest.setup.ts"],
        globals: true,
      },
    }),
  ),
);
```

For now, `qwik-testing-library` needs to consider your project as a lib ([PR welcomed][prs] to simplify this).
Hence, the `build.lib` section in the config above.

As the build will try to use `./src/index.ts` as the entry point, we need to create it:

```ts
// ./src/index.ts

/**
 * DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE
 *
 * This entrypoint is needed by @noma.to/qwik-testing-library to run your tests
 */
```

Then, create the `vitest.setup.ts` file:

```ts
// vitest.setup.ts

// Configure DOM matchers to work in Vitest
import "@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest";

// This has to run before qdev.ts loads. `beforeAll` is too late
globalThis.qTest = false; // Forces Qwik to run as if it was in a Browser
globalThis.qRuntimeQrl = true;
globalThis.qDev = true;
globalThis.qInspector = false;
```

This setup will make sure that Qwik is properly configured.
It also loads `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest` in your test runner
so you can use matchers like `expect(...).toBeInTheDocument()`.

By default, Qwik Testing Library cleans everything up automatically for you.
You can opt out of this by setting the environment variable `QTL_SKIP_AUTO_CLEANUP` to `true`.
Then in your tests, you can call the `cleanup` function when needed.
For example:

```ts
import {cleanup} from "@noma.to/qwik-testing-library";
import {afterEach} from "vitest";

afterEach(cleanup);
```

Finally, edit your `tsconfig.json` to declare the following global types:

```diff
// tsconfig.json

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": [
+     "vite/client",
+     "vitest/globals",
+     "@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest"
    ]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

## Examples

Below are some examples of how to use `@noma.to/qwik-testing-library` to tests your Qwik components.

You can also learn more about the [**queries**][tl-queries-docs] and [**user events**][tl-user-events-docs] over at the
Testing Library website.

[tl-queries-docs]: https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about

[tl-user-events-docs]: https://testing-library.com/docs/user-event/intro

### Qwikstart

This is a minimal setup to get you started, with line-by-line explanations.

```tsx
// counter.spec.tsx

// import qwik-testing methods
import {screen, render, waitFor} from "@noma.to/qwik-testing-library";
// import the userEvent methods to interact with the DOM
import {userEvent} from "@testing-library/user-event";
// import the component to be tested
import {Counter} from "./counter";

// describe the test suite
describe("<Counter />", () => {
  // describe the test case
  it("should increment the counter", async () => {
    // setup user event
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    // render the component into the DOM
    await render(<Counter/>);

    // retrieve the 'increment count' button
    const incrementBtn = screen.getByRole("button", {name: /increment count/});
    // click the button twice
    await user.click(incrementBtn);
    await user.click(incrementBtn);

    // assert that the counter is now 2
    await waitFor(() => expect(screen.findByText(/count:2/)).toBeInTheDocument());
  });
})
```

### Mocking Component Callbacks (experimental)

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is under a testing phase and thus experimental.
> Its API may change in the future, so use it at your own risk.

The Qwik Testing Library provides a `mock$` function
that can be used to create a mock of a QRL and verify interactions on your Qwik components.

It is _not_ a replacement of regular mocking functions (such as `vi.fn` and `vi.mock`) as its intended use is only for
testing callbacks of Qwik components.

Here's an example on how to use the `mock$` function:

```tsx title="counter.spec.tsx"
// import qwik-testing methods
import {mock$, clearAllMock, render, screen, waitFor} from "@noma.to/qwik-testing-library";
// import the userEvent methods to interact with the DOM
import {userEvent} from "@testing-library/user-event";

// import the component to be tested
import {Counter} from "./counter";

// describe the test suite
describe("<Counter />", () => {
  // initialize a mock
  // note: the empty callback is required but currently unused
  const onChangeMock = mock$(() => {
  });

  // setup beforeEach block to run before each test
  beforeEach(() => {
    // remember to always clear all mocks before each test
    clearAllMocks();
  });

  // describe the 'on increment' test cases
  describe("on increment", () => {
    // describe the test case
    it("should call onChange$", async () => {
      // setup user event
      const user = userEvent.setup();
      // render the component into the DOM
      await render(<Counter value={0} onChange$={onChangeMock}/>);

      // retrieve the 'decrement' button
      const decrementBtn = screen.getByRole("button", {name: "Decrement"});
      // click the button
      await user.click(decrementBtn);

      // assert that the onChange$ callback was called with the right value
      // note: QRLs are async in Qwik, so we need to resolve them to verify interactions
      await waitFor(() =>
        expect(onChangeMock.resolve()).resolves.toHaveBeenCalledWith(-1),
      );
    });
  });
})
```

### Qwik City - `server$` calls

If one of your Qwik components uses `server$` calls, your tests might fail with a rather cryptic message (e.g. `QWIK
ERROR __vite_ssr_import_0__.myServerFunctionQrl is not a function` or
`QWIK ERROR Failed to parse URL from ?qfunc=DNpotUma33o`).

We're happy to discuss it on [Discord][discord], but we consider this failure to be a good thing:
your components should be tested in isolation, so you will be forced to mock your server functions.

Here is an example of how to test a component that uses `server$` calls:

```ts
// ~/server/blog-posts.ts

import {server$} from "@builder.io/qwik-city";
import {BlogPost} from "~/lib/blog-post";

export const getLatestPosts$ = server$(function (): Promise<BlogPost> {
  // get the latest posts
  return Promise.resolve([]);
});
```

```tsx
// ~/components/latest-post-list.spec.tsx

import {render, screen, waitFor} from "@noma.to/qwik-testing-library";
import {LatestPostList} from "./latest-post-list";

vi.mock('~/server/blog-posts', () => ({
  // the mocked function should end with `Qrl` instead of `$`
  getLatestPostsQrl: () => {
    return Promise.resolve([{id: 'post-1', title: 'Post 1'}, {id: 'post-2', title: 'Post 2'}]);
  },
}));

describe('<LatestPostList />', () => {
  it('should render the latest posts', async () => {
    await render(<LatestPostList/>);

    await waitFor(() => expect(screen.queryAllByRole('listitem')).toHaveLength(2));
  });
});
```

Notice how the mocked function is ending with `Qrl` instead of `$`, despite being named as `getLatestPosts$`.
This is caused by the Qwik optimizer renaming it to `Qrl`.
So, we need to mock the `Qrl` function instead of the original `$` one.

If your function doesn't end with `$`, the Qwik optimizer will not rename it to `Qrl`.

## Gotchas

* Watch mode (at least in Webstorm) doesn't seem to work well: components are not being updated with your latest changes
